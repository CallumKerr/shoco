      <p>Here is all of it:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="kt">size_t</span> <span class="nf">shoco_compress</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">const</span> <span class="kt">char</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="k">const</span> <span class="n">in</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">size_t</span> <span class="n">len</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">char</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="k">const</span> <span class="n">out</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">size_t</span> <span class="n">bufsize</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="kt">size_t</span> <span class="nf">shoco_decompress</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">const</span> <span class="kt">char</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="k">const</span> <span class="n">in</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">size_t</span> <span class="n">len</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">char</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="k">const</span> <span class="n">out</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">size_t</span> <span class="n">bufsize</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>


<p>If the <code>len</code> argument for <code>shoco_compress</code> is 0, the input char is assumed to be null-terminated. If it’s a positive integer, parsing the input will stop after this length, or at a null-char, whatever comes first. <code>shoco_decompress</code> however will need a positive integer for <code>len</code> (most likely you should pass the return value of <code>shoco_compress</code>).</p>
<p>The return value is the number of bytes written. If it is less than <code>bufsize</code>, all is well. In case of decompression, a null-terminator is written. If the return value is exactly <code>bufsize</code>, the output is all there, but <em>not</em> null-terminated. It is up to you to decide if that’s an error or not. If the buffer is not large enough for the output, the return value will be <code>bufsize</code> + 1. You might want to allocate a bigger output buffer. The compressed string will never be null-terminated.</p>
<p>If you are sure that the input data is plain ASCII, your <code>out</code> buffer for <code>shoco_compress</code> only needs to be as large as the input string. Otherwise, the output buffer may need to be up to 2x as large as the input, if it’s a 1-byte encoding, or even larger for multi-byte or variable-width encodings like UTF-8.</p>
<p>For the standard values of <em>shoco</em>, maximum compression is 50%, so the <code>out</code> buffer for <code>shoco_decompress</code> needs to be a maximum of twice the size of the compressed string.</p>

      <header>
        <h2>How It Works</h2>
      </header>

      <p>Have you ever tried compressing the string “hello world” with <strong>gzip</strong>? Let’s do it now:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">&quot;hello world&quot;</span> | gzip -c | wc -c
32
</pre></div>


<p>So the output is actually <em>larger</em> than the input string. And <strong>gzip</strong> is quite good with short input: <strong>xz</strong> produces an output size of 68 bytes. Of course, compressing short strings is not what they are made for, because you rarely need to make small strings even smaller – except when you do. That’s why <strong>shoco</strong> was written.</p>
<p><strong>shoco</strong> works best if your input is ASCII. In fact, the most remarkable property of <strong>shoco</strong> is that the compressed size will <em>never</em> exceed the size of your input string, provided it is plain ASCII. What is more: An ASCII string is suitable input for the decompressor (which will return the exact same string, of course). That property comes at a cost, however: If your input string is not entirely (or mostly) ASCII, the output may grow. For some inputs, it can grow quite a lot. That is especially true for multibyte encodings such as UTF-8. Latin-1 and comparable encodings fare better, but will still increase your output size, if you don’t happen to hit a common character. Why is that so?</p>
<p>In every language, some characters are used more often than others. English is no exception to this rule. So if one simply makes a list of the, say, sixteen most common characters, four bits would be sufficient to refer to them (as opposed to eight bits – one byte – used by ASCII). But what if the input string includes an uncommon character, that is not in this list? Here’s the trick: We use the first bit of a <code>char</code> to indicate if the following bits refer to a short common character index, or a normal ASCII byte. Since the first bit in plain ASCII is always 0, setting the first bit to 1 says “the next bits represent short indices for common chars”. But what if our character is not ASCII (meaning the first bit of the input <code>char</code> is not 0)? Then we insert a marker that says “copy the next byte over as-is”, and we’re done. That explains the growth for non-ASCII characters: This marker takes up a byte, doubling the effective size of the character.</p>
<p>How <strong>shoco</strong> actually marks these packed representations is a bit more complicated than that (e.g., we also need to specify <em>how many</em> packed characters follow, so a single leading bit won’t be sufficient), but the principle still holds.</p>
<p>But <strong>shoco</strong> is a bit smarter than just to abbreviate characters based on absolute frequency – languages have more regularities than that. Some characters are more likely to be encountered next to others; the canonical example would be <strong>q</strong>, that’s <em>almost always</em> followed by a <strong>u</strong>. In english, <em>the</em>, <em>she</em>, <em>he</em>, <em>then</em> are all very common words – and all have a <strong>h</strong> followed by a <strong>e</strong>. So if we’d assemble a list of common characters <em>following common characters</em>, we can do with even less bits to represent these <em>successor</em> characters, and still have a good hit rate. That’s the idea of <strong>shoco</strong>: Provide short representations of characters based on the previous character.</p>
<p>This does not allow for optimal compression – by far. But if one carefully aligns the representation packs to byte boundaries, and uses the ASCII-first-bit-trick above to encode the indices, it works well enough. Moreover, it is blazingly fast. You wouldn’t want to use <strong>shoco</strong> for strings larger than, say, a hundred bytes, because then the overhead of a full-blown compressor like <strong>gzip</strong> begins to be dwarfed by the advantages of the much more efficient algorithms it uses.</p>
<p>If one would want to classify <strong>shoco</strong>, it would be an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_encoding">entropy encoder</a>, because the length of the representation of a character is determined by the probability of encountering it in a given input string. That’s opposed to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictionary_coder">dictionary coders</a> that maintain a dictionary of common substrings. An optimal compression for short strings could probably be achieved using an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_coding">arithmetic coder</a> (also a type of entropy encoder), but most likely one could not achieve the same kind of performance that <strong>shoco</strong> delivers.</p>
<p>How does <strong>shoco</strong> get the information about character frequencies? They are not pulled out of thin air, but instead generated by analyzing text with a relatively simple script. It counts all <em>bigrams</em> – two successive characters – in the text and orders them by frequency. If wished for, it also tests for best encodings (like: Is it better to spend more bits on the leading character or on the successor character?), and then outputs its findings as a header file for <code>shoco.c</code> to include. That means the statistical model is compiled in; we simply can’t add it to the compressed string without blowing it out of proportions (and defeating the whole purpose of this exercise). This script is shipped with <strong>shoco</strong>, and the <a href="#generating-compression-models">next section</a> is about how <em>you</em> can use it to generate a model that’s optimized for <em>your</em> kind of data. Just remember that, with <strong>shoco</strong>, you need to control both ends of the chain (compression <strong>and</strong> decompression), because you can’t decompress data correctly if you’re not sure that the compressor has used the same model.</p>

        <h2>Generating Compression Models</h2>
      </header>

      <p>Maybe your typical input isn’t english words. Maybe it’s german or french – or whole sentences. Or file system paths. Or URLs. While the standard compression model of <strong>shoco</strong> should work for all of these, it might be worthwile to train <strong>shoco</strong> for this specific type of input data.</p>
<p>Fortunately, that’s really easy: <strong>shoco</strong> includes a python script called <code>generate_compression_model.py</code> that takes one or more text files and ouputs a header file ready for <strong>shoco</strong> to use. Here’s an example that trains <strong>shoco</strong> with a dictionary (btw., not the best kind of training data, because it’s dominated by uncommon words):</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>./generate_successor_table.py /usr/share/dict/words -o shoco_model.h
</pre></div>


<p>There are options on how to chunk and strip the input data – for example, if we want to train <strong>shoco</strong> with the words in a readme file, but without punctuation and whitespace, we could do</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>./generate_successor_table.py --split<span class="o">=</span>whitespace --strip<span class="o">=</span>punctuation README.md
</pre></div>


<p>Since we haven’t specified an output file, the resulting table file is printed on stdout.</p>
<p>This is most likely all you’ll need to generate a good model, but if you are adventurous, you might want to play around with all the options of the script: Type <code>generate_compression_model.py --help</code> to get a friendly help message. We won’t dive into the details here, though – just one word of warning: Generating tables can be slow if your input data is large, and <em>especially</em> so if you use the <code>--optimize-encoding</code> option. Using <a href="http://pypy.org/">pypy</a> can significantly speed up the process. </p>

        <h2>Comparisons With Other Compressors</h2>
      </header>

      <h3>smaz</h3>
<p>There’s another good small string compressor out there: <a href="https://github.com/antirez/**smaz**"><strong>smaz</strong></a>. <strong>smaz</strong> seems to be dictionary based, while <strong>shoco</strong> is an entropy encoder. As a result, <strong>smaz</strong> will often do better than <strong>shoco</strong> when compressing common english terms. However, <strong>shoco</strong> typically beats <strong>smaz</strong> for more obscure input, as long as it’s ASCII. <strong>smaz</strong> may enlarge your string for uncommon words (like numbers), <strong>shoco</strong> will never do that for ASCII strings.</p>
<p>Performance-wise, <strong>shoco</strong> is typically faster by at least a factor of 2. As an example, compressing and decompressing all words in <code>/usr/dict/share/words</code> with <strong>smaz</strong> takes around 0.325s on my computer and compresses on average by 28%, while <strong>shoco</strong> has a compression average of 33% (with the standard model; an optimized model will be even better) and takes around 0.145s. <strong>shoco</strong> is <em>especially</em> fast at decompression.</p>
<p><strong>shoco</strong> can be trained with user data, while <strong>smaz</strong>’s dictionary is built-in. That said, the maximum compression rate of <strong>smaz</strong> is hard to reach for <strong>shoco</strong>, so depending on your input type, you might fare better with <strong>smaz</strong> (there’s no way around it: You have to measure it yourself).</p>
<h3>gzip, xz</h3>
<p>As mentioned, <strong>shoco</strong>’s compression ratio can’t (and doesn’t want to) compete with gzip et al. for strings larger than a few bytes. But for very small strings, it will always be better than standard compressors.</p>
<p>The performance of <strong>shoco</strong> should always be several times faster than about any standard compression tool. For testing purposes, there’s a binary inlcuded (unsurprisingly called <code>shoco</code>) that compresses and decompresses single files. The following timings were made with this command line tool. The data is <code>/usr/share/dict/words</code> (size: 4,953,680), compressing it as a whole (not a strong point of <strong>shoco</strong>):</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>compressor</th>
<th>compression time</th>
<th>decompression time</th>
<th>compressed size</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>shoco</td>
<td>0.070s</td>
<td>0.010s</td>
<td>3,393,975</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>xz</td>
<td>3.300s</td>
<td>0.148s</td>
<td>1,229,980</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>This demonstates quite clearly that <strong>shoco</strong>’s compression rate sucks, but also that it’s <em>very</em> fast.</p>

        <h2>Javascript Version</h2>
      </header>

      <p>For showing off, <strong>shoco</strong> ships with a Javascript version (<code>shoco.js</code>) that’s generated with <a href="https://github.com/kripken/emscripten">emscripten</a>. If you change the default compression model, you need to re-generate it by typing <code>make js</code>. You do need to have emscripten installed. The output is <a href="http://asmjs.org/">asm.js</a> with a small shim to provide a convenient API:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="nx">compressed</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">shoco</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">compress</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">input_string</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="nx">output_string</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">shoco</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">decompress</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">compressed</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The compressed string is really a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Uint8Array">Uint8Array</a>, since that resembles a C string more closely. The Javascript version is not as furiously fast as the C version because there’s dynamic (heap) memory allocation involved, but I guess there’s no way around it.</p>
<p><code>shoco.js</code> should be usable as a node.js module.</p>

      </header>

      <p>Most of them have been mentioned already, but for the sake of completeness – let’s have a quick overview over what you’ll find in the repo:</p>
<h4><code>shoco.c</code>, <code>shoco.h</code>, <code>shoco_model.h</code></h4>
<p>The heart of the project. If you don’t want to bother with nitty-gritty details, and the compression works for you, it’s all you’ll ever need.</p>
<h4><code>models/*</code></h4>
<p>As examples, there are more models included. Feel free to use one of them instead of the default model: Just copy it over <code>shoco_model.h</code> and you’re all set. Re-build them with <code>make models</code>.</p>
<h4><code>training_data/*</code></h4>
<p>Some books from <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/">Project Gutenberg</a> used for generating the default model.</p>
<h4><code>shoco.js</code></h4>
<p>Javascript library, generated by <strong>emscripten</strong>. Also usable as a <a href="http://nodejs.org/">node.js</a> module (put it in <code>node_modules</code> and <code>require</code> it). Re-build with <code>make js</code>.</p>
<h4><code>shoco.html</code></h4>
<p>A example of how to use <code>shoco.js</code> in a website.</p>
<h4><code>shoco</code></h4>
<p>A testing tool for compressing and decompressing files. Build it with <code>make shoco</code> or just <code>make</code>. Use it like this:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>shoco compress file-to-compress.txt compressed-file.shoco
<span class="nv">$ </span>shoco decompress compressed-file.shoco decompressed-file.txt
</pre></div>


<p>It’s not meant for production use, because I can’t image why one would want to use <strong>shoco</strong> on entire files.</p>
<h4><code>test_input</code></h4>
<p>Another testing tool for compressing and decompressing every line in the input file. Build it with <code>make test_input</code>. Usage example:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">time</span> ./test_input &lt; /usr/share/dict/words 
Number of compressed strings: 479828, average compression ratio: 33%

real   0m0.158s
user   0m0.145s
sys    0m0.013s
</pre></div>


<p>Adding the command line switch <code>-v</code> gives line-by-line information about the compression ratios.</p>
<h4><code>Makefile</code></h4>
<p>It’s not the cleanest or l33test Makefile ever, but it should give you hints for integrating <strong>shoco</strong> into your project.</p>
<h4><code>tests</code></h4>
<p>Invoke them with <code>make check</code>. They should pass.</p>

        <h2>Things Still To Do</h2>
      </header>

      <p><strong>shoco</strong> is stable, and it works well – but I’d have only tested it with gcc/clang on x86_64 Linux. Feedback on how it runs on other OSes, compilers and architectures would be highly appreciated! If it fails, it’s a bug (and given the size of the project, it should be easy to fix). Other than that, there’s a few issues that could stand some improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>There should be more tests, because there’s <em>never</em> enough tests. Ever. Patches are very welcome!</li>
<li>Tests should include model generation. As that involves re-compilation, these should probably written as a Makefile, or in bash or Python (maybe using <code>ctypes</code> to call the <strong>shoco</strong>-functions directly).</li>
<li>The Python script for model generation should see some clean-up, as well as documentation. Also it should utilize all cpu cores (presumably via the <code>multiprocess</code>-module). This is a good task for new contributers!</li>
<li>Again for model generation: Investigate why <strong>pypy</strong> isn’t as fast as should be expected (<a href="https://bitbucket.org/pypy/jitviewer/">jitviewer</a> might be of help here).</li>
<li>Make a real <strong>node.js</strong> module.</li>
<li>The current SSE2 optimization is probably not optimal. Anyone who loves to tinker with these kinds of micro-optimizations is invited to try his or her hand here.</li>
<li>Publishing/packaging it as a real library probably doesn’t make much sense, as the model is compiled-in, but maybe we should be making it easier to use <strong>shoco</strong> as a git submodule (even if it’s just about adding documentation), or finding other ways to avoid the copy&amp;paste installation.</li>

      <p>If you use <strong>shoco</strong>, or like it for whatever reason, I’d really love to <a href="mailto:christian.h.m.schramm%20at%20gmail.com%20-%20replace%20the%20'at'%20with%20@%20and%20delete%20this%20sentence-">hear from you</a>! If wished for, I can provide integration with <strong>shoco</strong> for your commercial services (at a price, of course), or for your totally awesome free and open source software (for free, if I find the time). Also, a nice way of saying thanks is to support me financially via
<a href="https://www.gittip.com/Ed-von-Schleck/">git tip</a> or <a href="https://flattr.com/submit/auto?user_id=Christian.Schramm&amp;url=https://ed-von-schleck.github.io/shoco&amp;language=C&amp;tags=github&amp;category=software">flattr</a>.</p>
<p>If you find a bug, or have a feature request, <a href="https://github.com/Ed-von-Schleck/shoco/issues/new">file it</a>! If you have a question about usage or internals of <strong>shoco</strong>, ask it on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask">stackoverflow</a> for good exposure – and write me a mail, so that I don’t miss it.</p>
