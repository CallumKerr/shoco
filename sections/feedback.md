If you use **shoco**, or like it for whatever reason, I’d really love to [hear from you](mailto:christian.h.m.schramm at gmail.com - replace the 'at' with @ and delete this sentence-)! If wished for, I can provide integration with **shoco** for your services (at a price, of course). Also, a nice way of saying thanks is to support me financially via
[git tip](https://www.gittip.com/Ed-von-Schleck/) or [flattr](https://flattr.com/submit/auto?user_id=Christian.Schramm&url=https://github.com/Ed-von-Schleck/&title=shoco&language=C&tags=github&category=software).

If you find a bug, or have a feature request, [file it](https://github.com/Ed-von-Schleck/shoco/issues/new)! If you have a question about usage or internals of **shoco**, ask it on [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask) for good exposure – and write me a mail, so that I don’t miss it.
